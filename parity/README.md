# Parity

*Know whether which value from 0 to 10 is even or odd!*

Yeah, I know. It sounds pretty boring, right? But this is my coding playground, I am allowed to do this kind of stuff to get to know new concepts or languages :)
Parity is a assignment given in the initial part of the Udemy course *Go: The complete developers guide*.
It was asked to print whether numbers in a sequence from 0 to 10 are odd or even, and that is my solution to it.

## Running

Well, it is not complex and... well... it is go, right? It just works out of the box. *go run*, *go build* and *go test* for running them.
If you don't already have go installed, download from its website: https://golang.org/dl/
