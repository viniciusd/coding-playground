# Cards

*Genereate a deck and play around with it: dealing, shuffling..*

Welcome to my coding playground! I use this place to get to know new concepts or languages :) Practicing in general.

Cards is the first project developed in the Udemy course *Go: The complete developers guide*.

The idea is to use this project to practice some initial concepts of Go. 

## Running

Well, it is not complex and... well... it is go, right? It just works out of the box. *go run*, *go build* and *go test* for running them.

If you don't already have go installed, download from its website: https://golang.org/dl/
